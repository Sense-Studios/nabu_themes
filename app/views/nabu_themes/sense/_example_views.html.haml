    Sense started out as
    %em visual jockeys
    in the Amsterdam Dance Scene of early 2000.

  %p
    Back then veejaying was still mostly done using
    %strong DVDs and even VHS tapes.
    We didnâ€™t even want to touch that, and came out with desktop computers,
    a mountain of sample footage and early mix programs like
    %em Resolume
    and
    %em Visual Jockey.
  %p
    Sense stood out with a
    %strong highly adaptive
    visual set that would later be characterized as
    %em Nu-veejaying.

    We've reached a point in our civilization
    %br
    where counterculture has mutated into a self-obsessed aesthetic vacuum.

  %p
    So while hipsterdom is the end product of all prior countercultures,
    %br
    it's been stripped of its subversion and originality.

  %p
    And is leaving a generation pointlessly obsessing over fashion,
    faux individuality, cultural capital and the commodities of style.
